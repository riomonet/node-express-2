List of bugs I found

1.  Allows for registration with no username or password 
2.  When a logged in user posts a get request GET http://localhost:3000/users/name_not_in_databases
   it shoul return a 404 error. right now it returns a {} object with no properties
3. on the PATCH route a user should be  allowed to change their own info without being an admin.
4. on the PATCH only and admin should be able to make another user and admin
5. no logout mechanism?
